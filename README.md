# Neural_canvas
This Web Application is a clone of the DALL-E image generation model, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. 

The repository contains code for both the front-end and back-end components of the web application. The front-end is likely built using React.js, while the back-end uses
Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and interactions with the MongoDB database. Cloudinary is used for storing images generated by the application.

The deployment process for this project involves using both Render and Netlify, which are cloud hosting platforms. It's possible that Render is used to host the 
back-end, while Netlify handles the front-end. The use of two different platforms may be for redundancy or for taking advantage of specific features of each platform.

Overall, this Github repository likely contains a fully-functional web application that allows users to generate DALL-E style images using the MERN stack and .
Cloudinary for storage, and is deployed using Render and Netlify.
